# final-project
This repository contains the source code to my final project


The requirements.txt file has all the dependencies needed to run the code. 
[Optional] Create a `conda` or `venv` virtual environment
Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

The code depends on the folder structure so any changes to the structure will require changes to the imports.
